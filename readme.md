## Why DeepseekR? 

🧠 **Pushing MoE (Mixture-of-Experts) Architecture to New Frontiers**  
While Deepseek already utilizes MoE internally, DeepseekR enables:

🔧 **Developer-Controlled Expert Orchestration**  
Create and manage specialized AI assistants with custom system messages

🤝 **Dynamic Expert Collaboration**  
Let a reasoner agent moderate conversations between multiple experts

🌱 **Lightweight Foundation**  
   Simple Swift implementation focused on extensibility using baked-in libraries rather than complexity

## Current Alpha Features (2 Hours In! ⏳)

✅ Basic chat completions interface  
✅ System message configuration  
✅ Deepseek-chat integration  
❌ Deepseek-reasoner implementation (coming soon)  
❌ Streaming (coming soon)  
❌ Expert moderation (coming soon)  
❌ Function calling (planned)  

## Developer Roadmap 🗺️

### Immediate Goals
- [ ] Chat with deepseek-reasoner implementation  
- [ ] Basic streaming support  
- [ ] Modular expert configuration  

### MoE Vision
```mermaid
graph TD
    User[User Input] --> Reasoner
    Reasoner -->|Route to| Expert1[Niche Expert 1]
    Reasoner -->|Route to| Expert2[Niche Expert 2]
    Expert1 -->|Response| Reasoner
    Expert2 -->|Response| Reasoner
    Reasoner -->|Curated Output| User
```
*Planned Expert Orchestration Flow*  
- **Expert Pool**: Multiple Deepseek instances with specialized system prompts  
- **Reasoner Core**: AI moderator handling expert selection and response synthesis  
- **Dynamic Composition**: Automatic expert team assembly based on conversation needs  

## Installation (Early Alpha)
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/InfinitIQ-Tech/DeepseekR.git

# Open in Xcode 15+
open DeepseekR.xcodeproj

# Build & Run (Requires macOS 14+)
```

### API Key Setup

Apply for your API key at [https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys), then create a `.env` file in the `DeepseekR/` source folder:

```bash
echo 'DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here' > DeepseekR/.env
```

The `.env` file is gitignored, so your key never enters source control. Xcode copies it into the app bundle at build time, where the sandboxed app reads it on launch.

⚠️ Because the key is baked into the built app, don't distribute your `.app` bundle.

## Contributing Opportunities 🤝

### 🧩 MoE Architecture
- Expert routing algorithms  
- Response synthesis strategies  
- Load balancing between experts  

### 🚢 Core Infrastructure
- macOS native UI improvements
- Secure credential storage

### 🧪 Research Directions
- Expert specialization metrics  
- Collaborative prompting techniques  
- Failure recovery mechanisms  

## Disclaimer ⚠️
This is an **EXTREMELY EARLY** experimental project (literally 2 hours old!). Expect:  
- 🔨 Breaking API changes (it's currently not a framework, just an app)
- 🔥 Missing error handling
- 📦 Basic UI implementation

**Not production-ready** - Ideal for MoE researchers and Swift AI enthusiasts wanting to shape foundational architecture.

We believe *The expert of tomorrow will be the system that best coordinates specialized knowledge* - Let's build that future together!
